# Fast Explorer Map
## Problem Statement
When the complexities of representing a 3D world on a 2D plane lead to distortions in mapping, the need for effective and precise geographical and route planning becomes critical.

Our C++ project, inspired by Google Maps and Baidu, features the Map of Pakistan where, upon the user's selection of source city and destination city, the distance between them is calculated by making use of Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Solution
This system allows you to explore and analyze various aspects of maps in Pakistan, including:
  1. Visualization of cities and their geographical coordinates
  2. Exploration of neighboring cities to analyze connectivity
  3. Calculation of the shortest path between source and destination cities
  4. Estimation of travel costs based on passenger type, vehicle selection, and applicable discounts

By prioritizing simplicity, precision, and computational efficiency, "Fast Explorer Map" provides a practical solution for spatial exploration and cost-effective route optimization.

Overall, this project uses OOP principles, alongside Data Structures and Algorithms to solve daily life problems. In our case, we make use of them to create a shortest path finder between any two cities in Pakistan.
